## Twitter Stream listener based on Twitter Early Access v2 endpoints

### Overview

This Python script collects information from Twitter stream and
pushes Tweets to PubSub.
The Twitter API gives developers access to most of Twitterâ€™s functionality.
You can use the API to read and write information related to Twitter
entities such as tweets, users, and trends.

Technically, the API exposes dozens of HTTP endpoints related to:

  - Tweets
  - Retweets
  - Likes
  - Direct messages
  - Favorites
  - Trends
  - Media

developer account and get Authentication information

Twitter API requires that all requests use OAuth to authenticate. You
need to:
  - Apply for a Twitter Developer Account
  - Create an application

Once you create the authentication credentials you will be able to use
the API. These credentials are the following text strings:
